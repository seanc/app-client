# App Client
SoundCove's application is single-paged.  It's orientated around dynamic HTML5 URLs (falling back on hash URLs), and uses WebSockets to fetch information from the API server asynchronously.

## Contributing
Assuming you've forked, cloned, and `cd`ed:

 1. `npm install` to install dependencies.  (this will automatically `bower install` too)
 2. `npm test` to start the gulp watchers and `app-server`.
